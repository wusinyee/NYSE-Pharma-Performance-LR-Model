### Best Practices for User-Friendly Documentation:

1. Use clear, concise language and avoid jargon where possible.
2. Include a detailed table of contents and index for easy navigation.
3. Use consistent formatting and structure throughout the document.
4. Include diagrams, flowcharts, and screenshots to illustrate complex concepts.
5. Provide examples and use cases to demonstrate how to use the model and interpret results.
6. Include cross-references between related sections.
7. Use a question-and-answer format for the troubleshooting guide.
8. Implement a clear hierarchical structure with numbered sections and subsections.
9. Include a search functionality if the documentation is digital.
10. Regularly update the documentation to reflect any changes in the model or processes.
